Welcome to Pythium's documentation!
===================================

**Pythium**  is a Python framework for high-energy physics analyses, allowing the user to perform sklimming, histogramming, plotting and statistical inference on data or Monte-Carlo simulations from the major LHC expirements. This project is part of an ongoing revolution against ROOT/C++ based code used in expirments like ATLAS, which aims to achieve faster and more user-friendly analysis experience. 

The name "Pythium" is inspired by a genus of parasites which attacks the *roots* of crops. Name and logo credits go to Callum Birch-Sykes
