.. _installation:

Getting started with Pythium is quite easy. At the moment, Pythium is avialable on `Test PyPI` since we are still in development stage. To install it as a user, go to your favorite virtual enviornment and run: 

.. code-block:: python
    
    pip install --extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ pythium

which will deliver the pythium wheel to you and install all dependancies (a long list for now).
