Description:

This script contains various cpython objects which are used to slim-down Ntuples as part of the
pythium framework. The objects will be filled byt he user in a configuration file, and instances
are created in-place. The instances are stored and the information is retrieved in separate scripts
to perform the slimming with Uproot4

	For each sample, there will be a collection of Tree objects, one for each tree in the Sample.
	The Tree object will construct the full path to the files relevant for the given Sample, incl
	the TTree name added to end of path (/path/to/files:tree). The Tree object is also aware
	of the branches to keep, make or drop from its tree.. Based on the user specified branches, a regex
	filter to select/deselect a branch will be built.
	If a branch is new and constructed from an expression, the Tree object will breakdown the expr
	to extract the branches used to calculate it. The breakdown of expression assumes the branch names in
	the expression are exact -- no regex is allowed in expressions.
